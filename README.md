# Nextflick

Nextflick is a content-based recommendation system for movies. It takes its
name from [Netflix][1], one of the largest over-the-top content platforms in
our age, whose own recommendation system serves as a source of inspiration for
this project.

### Dataset

The dataset used is [The Movies Dataset][2], which contains metadata for over
45,000 movies released on or before July 2017. While dated, this dataset was
the largest I could find of its kind in the public domain, as well as one of
the cleanest.
